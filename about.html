        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        <p>The Holy Angel University Parade Band, also known as the Marching Band, was established on 1965, during Holy Angel University's 32nd year. This milestone year was particularly significant for the university, as it also marked the introduction of the Graduate Programs in Education. The creation of the Parade Band not only added a lively musical aspect to the university's cultural life but also symbolized a period of growth and academic expansion.</p>
